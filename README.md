Case Studies and Final Project from COGS 137: Practical Data Science in R in collaboration with Joshu Suh and Angela Chapman


**Case Study 1: Youth Disconnection Rates**

Practical Data Science focuses on what’s practical. Researching the quantitative history of America’s societal issues is helpful to understanding future predictions and why these predictions can fall into place. This case study focuses on youth disconnection rates across the United States of America.

Youth disconnection is defined as “teenagers and young adults between the ages of 16 and 24 who are neither in school nor working” (Making The Connection, Lewis) Youth disconnection is a prominent factor of an adult life and can affect a human’s future.

This data comes from “Making The Connection: Transportation and Youth Disconnection” by Kristen Lewis written in 2019. Lewis not only focuses on youth disconnection by gender, race, and ethnicity but also youth disconnections by place, nationally, disabilities, and its correlation with transportation.

The data we focus on is a subset of their analysis that dives into gender and ethnicity among youth disconnection. Within youth disconnection rates we focused on the seven major race ethnicities, Latinx ethnicities, and Asian ethnicities. All groups are categorized by gender, race, and ethnicity. The data points range from 2008 to 2017 for all major ethnicities and data points for Latinx and Asian subgroups come from 2017 and 2018.

Our focus delves deeper into how have youth disconnection rates in American youth changed since 2008? In particular, how has this changed for different gender and ethnic groups? Are any groups particularly disconnected?


**Case Study 2: Relationship between poverty rates, unemployment rates and, crime rates**

America is experiencing an increasing number of violent, gun-related crimes, and most of it leads to a debate of whether the right to carry arms is exacerbating the problem. Some will argue that the existence of RTC (Right to Carry) laws in the first place causes higher violence rates, while others will argue that the spike in violent shootings have no correlation with the existence of RTC laws. With the recent wave of more states eliminating the need to have a concealed carry permit, it seems very likely that the former is true. In fact, a study done by John Donohue III, et al. finds that there is a strong relationship between RTC laws and overall violent crime rates, where crime rates increase when RTC laws are less regulated in the states. This of course is a stark contrast to a study done by John Lott Jr. back in 2012, where he states that lower regulation of guns do not necessarily increase gun violence. However, if Lott’s statement is true, why is there a higher number of violent crimes now, especially when states are lessening their gun regulations?

Our group aims to explore this in more detail, but instead of trying to explore any interaction between RTC laws and crime rates, we wanted to see if there are any extraneous factors that might affect crime rates. As the debate roars on about RTC laws vs crime rates, we wondered if other factors including poverty rates and unemployment rates were purposefully left out of the picture for the sake of moving an agenda forward. We will explore the relationship between poverty rates and unemployment rates across the states and across the years, and find out if there are any significant interactions between these factors and crime rates.

**Case Study 3: Youth Falvor Vaping Rates **

Upon first hearing the term, “vaping epidemic”, one would be surprised to find out that it is not at all related to virology. However, it perfectly characterizes the alarming scale at which nicotine and tobacco products are distributed to teenagers. Vapes and e-cigarettes are advertised as a “safe alternative to cigarettes,” and their supposed function is to help heavy smokers cut their smoking habits. Studies show that vapes and e-cigs have a promising effect as a replacement nicotine delivery device, and its less carcinogenic composition would make it a lot safer than smoking conventional cigarettes. However, their less threatening marketing, ease of use and their flash-drive-like appearance made vapes a perfect device for a curious teenager who wanted to smoke. All of the stigma around cigarettes was destroyed, as the marketing could be interpreted as the vape being the “anti-cigarette.” And without the pungent cigarette smell and the need to burn anything, vaping proved to be harder to spot. Furthermore, with companies like JUUL introducing sweet, fruity flavors, the vaping trend quickly spread among adolescents all over the U.S.. Even if the vape is less carcinogenic than a traditional cigarette, introducing nicotine to teenagers in a form of a pleasurable pastime would only lead to a dependence on nicotine. 

We will explore the National Youth Tobacco Surveys (NYTS) from the CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/surveys/nyts/index.htm) that were taken by adolescents from age 9 to 18(+) during the years 2015 through 2019, and try to find a trend that could help explain the rampant growth of tobacco products among youths.

To extend our analysis we decided to look look at tabacco flavors across gender for teenagers since they have been a target audience for the most popular e-cigarette company, such as JUUL.This is meaningful as targeted marketing towards teens can lead to a trying cigarettes. FDA states, "In particular, evidence shows that youth exposure to nicotine can adversely affect the developing adolescent brain and that, compared with non-users, youth who use e-cigarettes are more likely to try conventional cigarettes in the future." Have these flavors truly helped attract teenagers into vaping? If so, what flavors? And do these results differ from gender to gender?
